# Labs-2025
Lab 1, Lab 2, and Lab 3 for Code review. 
Lab 1 and Lab 3 are pretty final and need a true QC / check to see if they are correct in correlation to the lab problems. If there are any corrections, drawing it out or throwing the program into rslogix (I use rslogix micro starter lite, if that is relevant)
Lab 2 has the groundwork but I need help finalizing the last bit to truly get it to the criteria level
The "Hint" is saying that I need to latch and unlatch both valves nad the motor - which I need to do to get full credit but I'm not 100% sure I have it right with the OTLs, OTUs, and the timers. 
If there are adjustments for Lab 2 to make it final, please see line 3 and either draw it or program it into RSLogix
Let me know if there are any questions, thank you!
